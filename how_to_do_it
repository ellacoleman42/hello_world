#to get this working we deleted the existing workspace from cloud9
#created a new workspce in cloud9 from the github repository
#open new terminal session in cloud9 by ALT-T
#then for each new file we used a terminal session to run:   git add . <filename>
#then once for this set of changes ran in a terminal  git commit -m "description comment about change"
#finally to sync this to github run in a terminal :  git push -u origin master
